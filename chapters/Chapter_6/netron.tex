pip install netron

# Launch Netron to visualize a model
import netron
netron.start('model.onnx')
\end{verbatim}

\section{Using Netron}

\subsection{Opening a Model}
To visualize a model in Netron, you can either drag and drop the model file into the Netron application or use the command line to launch Netron with the specified model file.\index{Opening a Model}

\begin{verbatim}
# Launch Netron with a model file from the command line
netron model.onnx
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Inspecting Layers}
Once the model is loaded, you can click on individual layers to view detailed information about each layer, such as the type, input/output shapes, parameters, and attributes.\index{Inspecting Layers}

\subsection{Navigating the Graph}
Use the zoom and pan features to navigate through the model graph. You can also expand and collapse nodes to manage the complexity of large models.\index{Navigating the Graph}

\subsection{Exporting Visualizations}
Netron allows users to export the visualized model graph as an image or JSON file for documentation and sharing purposes.\index{Exporting Visualizations}

\begin{verbatim}
# Export the model graph as an image
File -> Export as PNG

\section{Case Study: Visualizing a Convolutional Neural Network}

\subsection{Setup}
In this case study, we demonstrate how to use Netron to visualize a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.\index{Case Study}

\begin{verbatim}
# Import necessary libraries
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset

# Define a simple CNN model
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 512)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, 10)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 32 * 8 * 8)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Create a model instance and save it
model = SimpleCNN()
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'simple_cnn.pth')

# Convert the model to ONNX format
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "simple_cnn.onnx")
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Visualizing the Model}
To visualize the CNN model using Netron, we will open the `simple_cnn.onnx` file.\index{Visualizing the Model}

\begin{verbatim
# Launch Netron to visualize the model
netron.start('simple_cnn.onnx')
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Inspecting Layers and Parameters}
By clicking on the individual layers in Netron, we can inspect the details such as input/output shapes, layer types, and parameters.\index{Inspecting Layers and Parameters}

\subsection{Exporting the Visualization}
We can export the visualized model graph as an image or JSON file for documentation purposes.\index{Exporting the Visualization}

\begin{verbatim
# Export the model graph as an image
File -> Export as PNG

# Export the model graph as a JSON file
File -> Export as JSON
