\section{Sequence Generation}
Sequence generation involves generating sequences of data, such as text or time series.

\subsection{Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)}
RNNs are used for sequence data and have a feedback loop to maintain information about previous inputs.

\subsection{Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)}
LSTMs are a type of RNN designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequence data.

\subsection{Transformers}
Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to handle dependencies in sequences more efficiently.

\section{Diffusion Models}
Diffusion models generate data by iteratively refining a noisy initial state.

\section{Neural Style Transfer}
Neural style transfer involves generating an image by combining the content of one image with the style of another.

\section{Text-to-Image Generation}
Text-to-image generation models generate images based on textual descriptions.
